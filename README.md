# Self-Avoiding-Random-Walk
The files in this repository simulates a free random walk (FRW), a self avoiding random walk (SAW)
and a SAW with simple biased sampling.
This is done on a simple cubic lattice, in 1,2,3 and 4 dimensions.
Also the programs carries out a Monte Carlos simulation which runs all walk 10^4 times.
